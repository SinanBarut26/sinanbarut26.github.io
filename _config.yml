  I heard something in Halt and Catch Fire movie. It’s related to tech, and I’m so impressed.”I know that something’s coming, something big, like a train, and all I want is to jump on board. But it’s getting faster and faster and I’m terrified I’m going to miss it … I don’t want to get left behind.” When I think of this sentence I get excited. You can follow posts in [my blog](https://blog.sinanbarut.net/)
